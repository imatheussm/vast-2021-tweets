# Visual Analysis Science and Technology (VAST) 2021
**Our take on the third mini-challenge.**

A basic Python dashboard that allows a visual, interactive exploratory scrutiny of the microblog and call center messages under the third VAST 2021 mini-challenge (available at [@vast-challenge/2021-sample-data](https://github.com/vast-challenge/2021-sample-data/)). You can see this application working by clicking on the `MyBinder` button above. A `.html` version of the `.ipynb` notebook was also produced to make the visualization of this work more convenient.

## Requirements

This application mainly relies on `altair` and `jupyterlab` to work. Such modules were listed under `requirements.txt` with the versions used to ensure optimal reproducibility (the Python version is also specified under `runtime.txt`). We thank the developers of all modules we took advantage of to make the development of this project easier.
